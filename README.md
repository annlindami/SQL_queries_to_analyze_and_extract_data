# SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a database

The dataset used is the 'Netflix Titles' dataset obtained from Kaggle.

I have used MySQL Workbench for the execution of the following queries, for the extraction and analysis of the dataset.

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), Subqueries, SUM, AVG

The zip file includes the output of each query.
